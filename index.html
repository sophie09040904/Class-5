If the passenger insisted on being served an alcoholic drink, then I would reduce his consumption of alcohol by delaying delivery on purpose and by diluting the drink.

If so, I would offer the passenger the meal of his or her choice. If it were not available, I would provide extra service to keep the passenger happy, and I would make sure that the passenger's preference was satisfied for the next in-flight meal service by taking an order from the passenger in advance."

Of course, I would try to make the passenger satisfied with my extraordinary service during the flight."
